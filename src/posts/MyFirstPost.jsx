          How I Got Back Into Web Development After a Career Break
        </h1>
        <p className="text-sm text-gray-500 mb-6">Posted April 2025</p>
  
        <h2 className="text-2xl mb-3 text-blue-800">Intro</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
        After working in web development and software testing for over a decade, I stepped away from my career in 2022 to become a full-time carer for my father, who was diagnosed with dementia. It was a difficult but deeply important decision, and for a while, I wasn’t sure if I’d ever return to tech.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
        Fast forward to 2025 — and I’m back. I’ve rebuilt my portfolio, retrained with modern tools like React and Tailwind CSS, and I’m now actively looking for freelance or part-time work in web development.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
        I wanted to share my story for others who might be in a similar position — whether you’ve taken time off to care for someone, raise a family, or deal with life’s curveballs. Getting back into tech is possible, and in this post, I’ll walk through how I did it.

        <GiJigsawPiece className="mr-2" />The Career Break
        </h2>

        <p className="mb-4">
        In mid-2022, I became a full-time carer for my father, who was living with dementia. As anyone who has been in a caring role knows, it’s a responsibility that demands your full attention, patience, and energy. It wasn’t an easy decision to pause my career — I had spent over 10 years working in web development, QA, and tech support — but it was the right one for my family.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
        During that time, I wasn’t coding regularly or working in the tech industry, but I never fully let go of my passion for building and learning. I would occasionally read tech blogs or browse GitHub projects, and I always knew that when the time was right, I’d want to come back.</p>

        <p className="mb-4">
        Caring full-time taught me a lot about time management, problem-solving under pressure, and resilience — all of which are qualities that apply directly to a career in tech. It also gave me perspective on what kind of work I want to do next: meaningful, flexible, and creative.</p>

        <FcMakeDecision className="mr-2" />Deciding to Return
        </h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
        After nearly three years away from the tech world, I started to feel that pull again — the desire to create, to solve problems, and to keep learning. I missed the sense of flow I used to get when coding, and I began to feel ready to re-enter that space.</p>


        <p className="mb-4">
        At first, I wasn’t sure where to start. Technology had moved fast — React had changed, new frameworks like Vite were popular, and Tailwind CSS was everywhere. I wondered: Would I be too far behind? Would employers overlook me because of my age or my gap in employment?</p>

        <p className="mb-4">
        Caring full-time taught me a lot about time management, problem-solving under pressure, and resilience — all of which are qualities that apply directly to a career in tech. It also gave me perspective on what kind of work I want to do next: meaningful, flexible, and creative.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
        So I made the decision to treat this as a fresh start, not a step backward. I gave myself permission to be a beginner again in some areas, and I leaned into learning with curiosity and openness — just like I had when I first started coding years ago.
