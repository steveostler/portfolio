        <p className="text-lg mb-4">
          I’m a web developer with over 10 years of experience in building and testing websites. 
          My background spans frontend development, QA testing, and technical support. I’ve worked 
          in agile teams, built over 100 responsive websites for schools, and tested web and mobile apps.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg mb-4">
          From 2022 to early 2025, I took time away from work to be a full-time carer for my father, who has dementia. 
          During that time, I maintained my interest in web development and have recently retrained in modern tools 
          such as React, Node.js, and Python.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg">
          I’m now actively seeking freelance, part-time, or full-time opportunities to return to the tech industry. 
          I bring life experience, technical ability, and a strong work ethic to every role.
